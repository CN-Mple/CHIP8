**This is a Simple CHIP8 emulator written in C.**

This project is based on the "DEV" platform using the console window as a black and white display( If your DEV is ready, you can compile directly to F11 ).

CHIP8 is the oldest simulator born in 1970, it has 35 opcodes, I wanted to increase its portability, so I chose to use C to implement itðŸ¤£.
